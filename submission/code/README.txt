CS180 Project 2 â€” How to run

1) Environment:
   - Python 3.10+ recommended
   - pip install -r requirements.txt (if provided)

2) Entry point:
   python3 main.py

3) What main.py does:
   - Discovers and runs all src/run_*.py scripts in ascending order.
   - Outputs figures to ../out (same paths as my dev repo) or to ./out if needed.

4) Notes:
   - If any script expects images from my website repo, it will fail gracefully or look in ./data.
   - The PDF in ./web/page.pdf contains all results for grading.

5) The pdf file has colors that have been washed out. To view the 

   webpage  with all colors and images not cutoff, please visit this link
